# GitHub Tutorial

## Git vs. GitHub
**Git**: a platform that keeps snapshots of your code (version control)  
* Runs in the Command line 
* not open to viewers besides yourself
* One can create a directory; initalizing git allows the directory to become a repository -->   
later allowing you to:
    * edit files
    * add files
    * commit files

**Github**: stores your code in the cloud platform (a website; for example: Github.com)
* easy way to collaborate on projects when working with a partner
* It is an opensource (everyone with access to github can view your work)
* simple way to track changes made on the project with just a few commands
* MOST IMPORTANTLY: One cannot use Github without Git, however, Git does not need to contain Github to be activated

## Initial Setup
_**How to set up your account with Github...**_

1. Go to github.com and press the button that says "sign up"
    * use an email and password (for HSTAT students, sign up using your school email and password)
    * once you're done signing up, check your email and verify with github  

2. Go to c9.io
    * creat an account(first/last name, email, password, etc.)
    * once set up, press on the gear in the top right corner
    * go to connected services
    * connect your github with cloud9 by clicking on the connect button  

3. In the future you will sign into cloud9 using your github account. This is how you do it...

4. Creating an SSH key(between Github & cloud9)  
* Github  
        * Being signed in at Github.com, go to your profile icon in the top right and press settings  
        * go to the left sidebar and then into SSH and GPG keys  
        * press New SSH and give it a title of your choice (unless a teacher instructs otherwise)    
* Cloud9  
        * go to the gear icon in the top right corner  
        * navigate to the SSH keys tab  
        * copy/paste your SSH key (begins with ssh-rsa) into Github  
        * Add SSH key

## Repository Setup
_**To create your 1st repository...**_  
1. go to Github.com and click on the **(+)**, then click **New Repository**
    ![below is the snapshot attached](https://github-images.s3.amazonaws.com/enterprise/11.10.340/user/assets/images/help/repository/repo-create.png)    
2. Create a short and sweet name for your repository (for example: first-repo)  
3. Keep it **Public**, so people can check out your work, fork it, clone it, and add their own changes with your permission)  
4. Finally, click **Create Repository** (this will be your remote repository)  
5. After that, this screen will show up

6. Copy/paste the two links under the section titled "or push an existing repository from the commnad line, one at a time"  
* After creating the repository on cloud9, follow the steps below and then continue with these two links spoken of above

_YAY for you! You successfully created your first repository and initialized a README.md file inside of it_

_**Add, Commit, and Push your First Changes...**_    
_Make your first repository on cloud9:_  
1. Go to c9.io and open your workspace      
2. (Begin typing in the command line) To make sure you're inside your workspace, type:
    ```
    cd ~/workspace
    ```   
3. Next, type:  
    ```
    mkdir and (the name you gave your first repository on github when making it)
    ```
    ```
    for example: mkdir first-repo
    ```   
4. Go inside of your repository by typing:
    ```
    cd (name of your repository) 
    ```    
5. Then, type:
    ```
    git init
    ```    

_Add a README.md file:_  
1. Since the remote repository was already created on github, in your command line on cloud9 after all the code you just typed, continue typing:
    ```
    touch README.md
    ```  
2. Then, as soon as you press enter after making it, you can either press on the file in the sidebar under the name of your repository or you can type:
    ```
    c9 README.md
    ```  
3. In the README.md file, type in a message that will show up in github (for example: This is my first repo )  
4. Press the keyboard keys "command" & "s" to save your work in the file  
5. In the command line, type:
    ```
    git add .
    ```  
6. Next, think of a good commit message that would be in the present tense, once again short, to the point, and about the change you just executed; type:
    ```
    git commit -m "the message you think would be right"
    ```
    ```
    for example: git commit -m "create readme.md"
    ```  
7. Copy/paste the links one at a time, like stated above, in the command line after following the directions(steps) listed before this one:
    ```
    git remote add origin git@github.com:biannak6288/3rd-repo.git
    ```  
    ```
    git push -u origin master
    ```
