# GitHub Tutorial

## Git vs. GitHub
**Git**: a platform that keeps snapshots of your code (version control)  
* Runs in the Command line 
* not open to viewers besides yourself
* One can create a directory; initalizing git allows the directory to become a repository -->   
later allowing you to:
    * edit files
    * add files
    * commit files

**Github**: stores your code in the cloud platform (a website; for example: Github.com)
* easy way to collaborate on projects when working with a partner
* It is an opensource (everyone with access to github can view your work)
* simple way to track changes made on the project with just a few commands
* MOST IMPORTANTLY: One cannot use Github without Git, however, Git does not need to contain Github to be activated

## Initial Setup
**_ How to set up your account with Github..._**

1. Go to github.com and press the button that says "sign up"
    * use an email and password (for HSTAT students, sign up using your school email and password)
    * once you're done signing up, check your email and verify with github  

2. Go to c9.io
    * creat an account(first/last name, email, password, etc.)
    * once set up, press on the gear in the top right corner
    * go to connected services
    * connect your github with cloud9 by clicking on the connect button  

3. In the future you will sign into cloud9 using your github account. This is how you do it...  

![ Alt if you want to sign-in to github using c9, this is where you go...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OperationSpark/using-c9/master/img/c9-signin-github.png)  

4. Creating an SSH key(between Github & cloud9)
    * Github
        * Being signed in at Github.com, go to your profile icon in the top right and press settings
        * go to the left sidebar and then into SSH and GPG keys
        * press New SSH and give it a title of your choice (unless a teacher instructs otherwise)
    * cloud9
        * go to the gear icon in the top right corner
        * navigate to the SSH keys tab
        * copy/paste your SSH key (begins with ssh-rsa) into Github
