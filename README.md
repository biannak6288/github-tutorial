## Git vs. GitHub
**Git**: keeps snapshots of your code (version control)  
* Runs in the Command line  
* One can create a directory; initalizing git allows the directory to become a repository -->   
later allowing you to:
    * edit files
    * add files
    * commit files

**Github**: stores your code in the cloud platform (a website; for example: Github.com)
* easy way to collaborate on projects when working with a partner
* It is an opensource (everyone with access to github can view your work)
* simple way to track changes made on the project with just a few commands
* MOST IMPORTANTLY: One cannot use Github without Git, however, Git does not need to contain Github to be activated
