# GitHub Tutorial

## Git vs. GitHub
**Git**: a platform that keeps snapshots of your code (version control)  
* Runs in the Command line 
* not open to viewers besides yourself
* One can create a directory; initalizing git allows the directory to become a repository -->   
later allowing you to:
    * edit files
    * add files
    * commit files

**Github**: stores your code in the cloud platform (a website; for example: Github.com)
* easy way to collaborate on projects when working with a partner
* It is an opensource (everyone with access to github can view your work)
* simple way to track changes made on the project with just a few commands
* MOST IMPORTANTLY: One cannot use Github without Git, however, Git does not need to contain Github to be activated

## Initial Setup
_**How to set up your account with Github...**_

1. Go to github.com and press the button that says "sign up"
    * use an email and password (for HSTAT students, sign up using your school email and password)
    * once you're done signing up, check your email and verify with github  

2. Go to c9.io
    * creat an account(first/last name, email, password, etc.)
    * once set up, press on the gear in the top right corner
    * go to connected services
    * connect your github with cloud9 by clicking on the connect button  

3. In the future you will sign into cloud9 using your github account. This is how you do it...

4. Creating an SSH key(between Github & cloud9)
    * Github
        * Being signed in at Github.com, go to your profile icon in the top right and press settings
        * go to the left sidebar and then into SSH and GPG keys
        * press New SSH and give it a title of your choice (unless a teacher instructs otherwise)
    * cloud9
        * go to the gear icon in the top right corner
        * navigate to the SSH keys tab
        * copy/paste your SSH key (begins with ssh-rsa) into Github
